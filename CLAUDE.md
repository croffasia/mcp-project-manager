These are existing instructions that should be preserved.

# MCP Task Manager - Project Instructions

## üìã Project Context & Management

This project uses MCP Task Manager for hierarchical task management with the
following structure:

- **Ideas** (IDEA-N) ‚Üí High-level features or concepts
- **Epics** (EPIC-N) ‚Üí Major implementation phases within ideas
- **Tasks** (TSK-N) ‚Üí Specific development tasks
- **Bugs** (BUG-N) ‚Üí Bug fixes and issues
- **Research** (RND-N) ‚Üí Research and spikes

## üéØ Core Workflow Instructions

### When user requests project/task management:

1. **ALWAYS analyze current project context first**
    - Read existing code structure, README, package.json
    - Understand implemented features and architecture
    - Identify current development state and priorities

2. **Create tasks based on EXISTING codebase analysis**
    - Reference actual files, components, and implementations
    - Consider current tech stack and patterns
    - Align with existing project structure and conventions

3. **Use natural language commands:**
    - `"pm init"` - Initialize project (creates .product-task/, counters.json,
      project-config.json ONLY)
    - `"Create idea 'User Authentication System'"` - Create new feature idea
    - `"Parse PRD 'Mobile App Features'"` - Auto-generate tasks from
      requirements
    - `"Give me next task"` - Get optimal task for current context
    - `"Update task TSK-5 status to in-progress"` - Update task status
    - `"Break down task TSK-3 into subtasks"` - Decompose complex tasks
    - `"Show all tasks"` - Display current task list

### Important: pm init behavior

- `pm init` should ONLY create the basic project structure:
    - `.product-task/` directory
    - `counters.json` file with initial counters
    - `project-config.json` with project name and description from
      package.json/README
- It should NOT automatically create any ideas, epics, or tasks
- It should NOT modify CLAUDE.md (instructions are already present)
- It should NOT create project-analysis.md

### Task Breakdown Strategy:

1. **Context-aware decomposition:**
    - Analyze existing similar implementations in the codebase
    - Consider current architecture patterns and file structure
    - Reference actual components, services, and utilities
    - Align with existing development practices

2. **Realistic scope estimation:**
    - Base estimates on similar completed work in the project
    - Consider current team velocity and complexity
    - Account for testing, documentation, and integration

3. **Dependency management:**
    - Identify prerequisites from existing codebase
    - Consider shared components and services
    - Plan for database migrations, API changes, etc.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Tasks are organized in hierarchical folders:

```
.product-task/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ counters.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IDEA-1/

## üé® ID Configuration

Current project uses these prefixes:

- Ideas: IDEA-N
- Epics: EPIC-N
- Tasks: TSK-N
- Bugs: BUG-N
- Research: RND-N

To modify prefixes, edit `project-config.json` in project root.

## üìä Example Usage

```
User: "I need to add user authentication to the app"
Response:
1. Analyze existing auth-related code
2. Create idea "User Authentication System"
3. Generate epics: "Auth API", "Frontend Integration", "Security"
4. Break down into specific tasks referencing actual files
5. Provide next actionable task with context
```

Remember: Always work within the context of THIS specific project's codebase and
architecture!

# üîß Backend Development Standards

## Core Development Principles

### KISS Principle

- Keep It Simple, Stupid - prioritize simplicity over complexity
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Each class/function should have one clear purpose
- Classes and modules should have only one reason to change
- Break down complex functionality into smaller, focused components

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
- Use composition and interfaces to extend behavior
- Avoid modifying existing code when adding new features

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Components should be replaceable with their subtypes
- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- Maintain behavioral consistency across implementations

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Prefer specific interfaces over general ones
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create focused, role-specific interfaces

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Use dependency injection and interface-based design

## Code Quality Standards

## Claude Code Task Management Instructions

### When Working with MCP Task Manager

Claude Code should automatically integrate with the MCP Task Manager when
working on this project. Follow these patterns:

#### 1. Starting Work on Tasks

When you see a task from `next_task` or `list_all_tasks`, ALWAYS:

- Update the task status to "in-progress" before starting work
- Add a progress note with type "update" describing what you're about to do
- Example:
  `"Update task TSK-5 to in-progress with note: Starting implementation of JWT middleware"`

#### 2. During Task Implementation

- Add progress notes as you complete significant milestones
- Use appropriate progress types:
    - `update`: Regular progress updates
    - `comment`: Additional context or decisions made
    - `blocker`: When you encounter blocking issues
    - `completion`: When task is fully complete

#### 3. When Task is Complete

- Update task status to "done"
- Add final progress note with type "completion"
- Include summary of what was accomplished
- Example:
  `"Mark task TSK-5 as done with completion note: JWT middleware implemented and tested"`

#### 4. Task Creation with Definition of Done

When creating new tasks (via `create_task`), ALWAYS include a comprehensive
"Definition of Done" section in the task description. Structure it as:

```
[Task Description]

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] [Specific deliverable based on current codebase]
- [ ] [Testing requirement specific to this project]
- [ ] [Code quality requirement]
- [ ] [Documentation requirement if applicable]
- [ ] [Integration requirement]
```

Analyze the current codebase to create realistic, specific DoD items. Examples:

- "Unit tests added following patterns in `test/` directory"
- "TypeScript types defined with proper JSDoc (English only)"
- "Database schema updated if needed with migration"
- "MCP tool registration updated in `src/index.ts`"
- "Error handling follows existing patterns in codebase"

#### 5. Automatic Task Discovery

When you notice work that should be tracked as tasks while implementing:

- Create new tasks for significant subtasks discovered during implementation
- Break down complex work into manageable pieces
- Reference existing code patterns and files in task descriptions

### Example Workflow

```
1. "Get next task" ‚Üí Receive TSK-3: "Implement user authentication"
2. "Update task TSK-3 to in-progress with note: Analyzing current auth patterns in codebase"
3. [Do analysis work]
4. "Add progress note to TSK-3: Created JWT middleware following existing patterns in src/middleware/"
5. [Continue implementation]
6. "Mark task TSK-3 as done with completion note: Authentication system implemented with JWT, following project patterns, all tests passing"
```

This ensures full visibility into development progress and maintains proper task
management discipline.
